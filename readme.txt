Dependencies for the project can be found in the pcGAN.yml file.

Code for the project can be found in the folder 'code', and results for the runs will be stored in the folder 'results'.

The file 'input.py' in the 'results' folder allows to specify settings for the runs.

A run be started by running 'pcGAN.py', or by running 'master.py';
the latter allows to loop over different settings.
Even when trying only one setting, running 'master.py' is recommended, since the results will then be stored in the folder which are accessed by default in the plotting scripts.

The scripts 'plot_KL_investigation.py' and 'plot_resuls.py' can be used to produce the plots shown in the paper.
